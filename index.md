## About Me

I am a Mechanical Engineer with a concentration in Mechatronics focused on building real-world intelligent systems that integrate hardware, software, and data-driven decision making.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Autonomous robotics  
- Embedded control systems  
- Intelligent sensing & signal processing  
- Machine learning for human movement analysis  
- AI-enabled engineering systems  

I enjoy taking ideas from concept → prototype → tested system. Whether it's a robot navigating a maze, wearable sensors analyzing gait, or aerodynamic instrumentation in a wind tunnel, I like solving problems that combine physical systems with computation.
